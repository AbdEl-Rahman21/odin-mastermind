# Mastermind

The second of two project for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind) OOP course.

## Description

It is a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs). Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.
